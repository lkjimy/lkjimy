##### What's the meaning of life, the universe and everything anyway?

People ask me "what's up with the nickname?" and I answer, "if I tell you, you will have to pay me"... Actualy I don't answer anything, because nobody asks.   
Let's keep it that way, shall we?   

I'm that guy who got into programming by curiosity and got myself into trouble by writing all kinds of crappy code, but who never, right...? right...?   
Been working on software developement for 7+ years, even though I studied Graphic Design. Do what you enjoy doing. Still learning and growing, I'll do it on my own timeline.

##### When people call you crazy, there's a fifty-fifty percent chance you really are... Food for thought.
