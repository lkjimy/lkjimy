Mechatronics Technician, Designer, currently working in technology as a Front End developer (with VueJs). With over 8 years of experience, I have encountered various challenges in different activities. Working in Frontend, I advocate for "keeping it simple," which is the philosophy I've found to be most productive lately, reminiscent of my internship days where I experimented with curious solutions using CSS and HTML. After all, the trend is for the browser to become increasingly capable of delivering more with less. 

In my daily work, I use Figma as the main tool for Interface Design, and VueJS as my preferred framework (separation of concerns + convenience = * chef's kiss * ), not to mention the entire Vue ecosystem, which is equally surprising (NuxtJs and other aggregated tools). 

Over the years, I've experienced a bit of everything. As a designer, I've produced print content, social media materials, brands, website layouts, ERPs, and Web Apps PWA. As a Front End programmer, I've worked with PHP and Javascript, eventually arriving at VueJs. I've learned a lot from incredible colleagues, who have become an inspiration to me. Software development is a constantly evolving field, and I'm grateful for the journey, knowing that I have much more to learn in the coming years.
